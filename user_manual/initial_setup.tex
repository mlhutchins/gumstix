\end{centering}

\subsection*{Method 1: SSH Setup}
The SSH setup method requires:
\begin{itemize}
\item{Ethernet cable}
\item{SSH capable computer}
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
\item{Connect SU to a host computer directly with an ethernet cable}
\item{Set host computer ethernet network settings to:
\begin{verbatim}
address:	192.168.10.1
gateway:	192.168.10.100
netmask:	255.255.255.0
\end{verbatim}}
\item{SSH into the SU from host computer:
\begin{verbatim}
ssh -p 7777 sferix@192.168.10.2
password: [	]
\end{verbatim}}
\item{Set desired static ip configuration in file $\sim$/networkSetup.sh}
\item{\begin{verbatim}
sudo ./networkSetup.sh
\end{verbatim}}
\item{Switch SU to main network ethernet within 1 minute of running networkSetup.sh}
\item{Test connection by SSH'ing into SU with new IP address}
\item{
\begin{enumerate}
\item{If successful: set new IP setting in /etc/network/interfaces}
\item{If unsuccessful: power cycle SU and check settings starting with step 3}
\end{enumerate}}
\item{Reset SU and confirm new settings}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Method 2: Workstation Setup}
The Workstation setup method requires:
\begin{itemize}
\item{HDMI Monitor and cable}
\item{{\bf Powered} USB Hub}
\item{USB Keyboard}
\item{USB Mouse}
\end{itemize}

Connect the powered USB hub to the back USB port of the service unit, and attach the keyboard and mouse to the hub.
Connect a monitor to the HDMI port, DVI - HDMI adapters work as well.
Power on the box, it will take a few minutes for the login screen to show up.
Select ``Other...'' and login with the username \textbf{host}.
Wait a few more minutes for the graphical display to load.

Adjust the network settings by either changing the files listed in Method 1, or by logging in as root as adjusting them through System $\rightarrow$ Network in the top menu bar.

\begin{enumerate}
\item{Connect an HDMI display, keyboard and mouse}
\item{Set network information through GUI}
\end{enumerate}


\subsection*{Method 3: Manual microSD Editing}

The file that need to be edited on the rootfs partition are:

\begin{verbatim}
/etc/network/interfaces
/etc/resolv.conf
/etc/ssh/sshd_config
\end{verbatim}

The interfaces file lists the IP information of the machine whole the resolv.conf file is for the DNS information.
The sshd\_config file on line 13 sets the port with which SSH is allowed.

\section*{Website Setup}
\end{centering}

\subsection*{Starting apache2}

To get apache2 running only one change needs to be made in the /etc/apache2/httpd.conf file.

\begin{verbatim}
Line 96:	#ServerName www.example.com:80
\end{verbatim}

Needs to be uncommented and changed to the hostname of the computer, e.g.:

\begin{verbatim}
Line96:	ServerName gumstix.ess.washington.edu:80
\end{verbatim}

Then httpd needs to be restarted:

\begin{verbatim}
sudo httpd -k restart
\end{verbatim}

\subsection*{Setting up the website}

All changes to the website need to be made in the /home/sferix/public\_html\_static folder, this folder is copied to /home/sferix/public\_html during start up. Changes to public\_html are not saves as the folder is located in system RAM due to SD card read/write limitations. A restart in not necessary if the public\_html\_static contents are copied to public\_html.
